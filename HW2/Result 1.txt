This R code snippet demonstrates two approaches to matrix multiplication: a non-vectorized approach with multiple for loops (slow_matrix_multiply) and a vectorized approach (fast_matrix_multiply). The non-vectorized approach uses nested loops to multiply matrices element-wise, while the vectorized approach utilizes the %*% operator for matrix multiplication, which is typically more efficient in R. The purpose of the original code was to make a for loop for matrix multiplication in an old course.
