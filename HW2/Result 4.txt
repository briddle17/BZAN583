The key change made was to replace the non-vectorized approach, which used nested for loops, with a vectorized approach using the %*% operator for matrix multiplication. This change significantly improved performance by leveraging R's optimized matrix multiplication implementation, which is more efficient than manual looping. Vectorized operations in R are generally faster because they are implemented in lower-level, optimized code compared to interpreted R code within loops.
